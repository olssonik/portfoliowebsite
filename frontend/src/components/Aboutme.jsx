    <p>
      I am a self-taught web developer who has learned through my own dedication
      and practice. I have explored different web development technologies like
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm quite good at them. By working on
      personal projects and constantly improving myself, I have developed a
      solid foundation in creating attractive and user-friendly websites. I have
      also focused on learning about Linux, which is a an operating system like
      Windows or macOS but a bit different. I have gained a lot of knowledge
      about different versions of Linux, how to use the command line, and how to
      write scripts. This expertise allows me to effectively manage computer
      systems, install software, and configure networks for web development. My
      main goal is to specialize in cybersecurity, which means protecting
      computer systems and data from online threats. I understand the importance
      of keeping digital information secure, and I am eager to learn more about
      cybersecurity practices. This includes identifying and preventing threats,
      assessing vulnerabilities, and responding to security incidents. I want to
      become a cybersecurity professional who can defend against evolving
      threats and make digital systems safer.
